# msda-capstone
## Author: Nic Vetter

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repo for my Master's of Science in Data Analytics through Northwest Missouri State University. 
Throughout the capstone project, I will be using analyzing the trends of public high school spending and proficiency percentages using the following tools/skills:

SQL, Machine Learning in Python, Tableau, Overleaf, and LaTeX. 

My hope is to show the correlation between Iowa Public Schools $/pupil and Math/Reading proficiency scores on standardized tests. 

I will then forecast the minimum $/pupil schools should be spending to meet proficiency standards. 

I am happy you are reading through this project and have a great day!

## Data Sources:
[Data Source 1](https://data.iowa.gov/Primary-Secondary-Ed/Math-And-Reading-Proficiency-in-Iowa-by-School-Yea/f3h8-mnxi/about_data)

[Data Source 2](https://data.iowa.gov/School-Finance/Iowa-School-District-Expenditures-by-Fiscal-Year/uutu-bzs3/about_data)

This data set was collected from the Iowa.gov website as public information. The Iowa.gov website
has an ”Action Query” function that helps the writer filter the necessary data from the dataset. This
is called preliminary cleaning of the dataset and the dataset will be cleaned again in section 3 of this
report. The writer will only be using the reading proficiency rating of the 2017 11th-grade students in
each respective district. This is to shorten the report for the tight time window

## Data Cleaning/Manipulation using PostgreSQL and PgAdmin:

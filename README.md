Hello and welcome to my GitHub repo for my Master's of Science in Data Analytics through Northwest Missouri State University. 
Throughout the capstone project, I will be using analyzing the trends of public high school spending and proficiency percentages using the following tools/skills:

SQL, Machine Learning in Python, Tableau, Overleaf, and LaTeX. 

My hope is to show the correlation between Iowa Public Schools $/pupil and Math/Reading proficiency scores on standardized tests. 

I will then forecast the minimum $/pupil schools should be spending to meet proficiency standards. 

I am happy you are reading through this project and have a great day!
